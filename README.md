Repository made for a project from the University course "Modelli matematici per la finanza" (Mathematical models for finance)
The project consists in estimating the value of stock options using quantum computing, in particular looking for a quadratic speedup compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. 
More on that in the notebooks.
The PDF file is the final essay of the course, where the theory, as well as the results, are shown
